# Privacy Policy

The policy applies to all information collected on Mind The App’s website and our apps for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV and Mac.

Your privacy is critically important to us. We intentionally do not use third-party analytics or ads in our apps, and collect no personally identifiable information, location data or cookies of any sort. We are committed to making sure that this remains the case.

## Security

Our apps only communicate with Apple’s servers, no third party is involved at any point. We use HTTPS to secure the communication between the app and Apple’s servers.

## Data Storage

Mind The App stores your data locally and synchronizes it between devices using Apple’s CloudKit. Mind The App will store your data in your private CloudKit container in order to synchronize it between devices. 

Therefore, we do not have access to any data stored in your iCloud account. We also do not have access to your Apple ID - only a unique identifier that is scoped to just our app. It is not possible to track your identity between apps with this identifier. You can revoke access to iCloud and delete all your data in the settings of your device.

## Your Consent

By using our website or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.

## Contact Information

If you have any questions or suggestions about this privacy policy, do not hesitate to contact us at [attila@mindtheapp.uk](mailto:attila@mindtheapp.uk).

## Changes to This Policy

We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently.

This policy is effective as of December 1, 2023.
